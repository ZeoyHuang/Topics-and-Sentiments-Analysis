# Topics and Sentiments Analysis during the COVID-19 Omicron Outbreak in Shanghai 2022

This repository contains the data, methodology, and findings of a study analyzing public topics and sentiments based on social media data during the COVID-19 Omicron variant outbreak in Shanghai 2022.

## Abstract

In 2022, the COVID-19 Omicron variant outbreak sparked a complex array of emotions among the residents of Shanghai, particularly during the two-month quarantine period. This study aims to capture the prevailing themes and sentiments from social media posts on Weibo, utilizing a dataset of 90,000 posts from the 2022 outbreak. Our research includes an analytical framework that merges hotspot analysis with public sentiment assessment, leveraging the Jieba word separation and TF-IDF word frequency calculation for data preprocessing, followed by sentiment quantification using the SnowNLP classification method. The study culminates in a spatial visualization of sentiment and concerns, segmented into time periods that align with the infection curve in Shanghai. The findings underscore how public sentiment is influenced by the epidemic's severity, emerging events, resource availability, and government responsiveness. The research illustrates the shifting focus of residents' concerns and their constant use of social media as a platform for expressing needs and emotions. This work contributes to public opinion analysis as a tool for improving governance during crises, enhancing urban resilience, and encouraging public participation in decision-making processes.
